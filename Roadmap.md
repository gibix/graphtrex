# Roadmap for graphtrex analysis

This project is intended to provide an implementation of complex network dynamics analysis on the various datasets generously provided by the [tracking.exposed]( https://facebook.tracking.exposed) team.

In particular the first couple of months of research are intended to dive into experimental datasets like that harvested during the [2017 French elections](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/experiments-data).

Analytics on different projects promoted by the community will be added in the future, for this propose moduarity is considered in 1.

All our analysis are focused on giving an heuristic insight onto the dynamical variations of news feed and timeline, in order to give to the final user a better prospective on how s\he's affected by algorithmic filtering.

## 1. Code style and functionality

The code available in the networkx folder, was inteded as a first draft on which kind of data structures
and graph metrics would have been employed. The code has a sequential appearance, whereas instead 
functions and dats strcutures should be re-usable.

[] Divide the code in two modules : data structure initialization and network analysis
[] Add a IPython notebook for graph visualization

## 2. Complex Network Analysis
