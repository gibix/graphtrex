# Roadmap for graphtrex analysis

This project is intended to provide an implementation of complex network dynamics analysis on
the various datasets generously provided by the [tracking.exposed]( https://facebook.tracking.exposed) team.
In particular the first couple of months of research are intended to dive into experimental datasets
like that harvested during the [2017 French elections](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/experiments-data).

Analytics on different projects promoted by the community will be added in the future, for this propose
moduarity is considered in 1.

All our analysis are focused on giving an heuristic insight onto the dynamical variations of news 
feed and timeline, in order to give to the final user a better prospective on how s\he's affected by algorithmic filtering.
